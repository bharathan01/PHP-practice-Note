<!-- The enctype="multipart/form-data" attribute is an attribute of the HTML <form> element. 
When a form includes file uploads, the enctype attribute must be set to "multipart/form-data". 
This is required to indicate to the browser that the form will contain binary data, 
such as files, and the browser should encode the form data accordingly before sending it to the server. -->
