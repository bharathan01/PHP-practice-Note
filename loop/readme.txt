Key Differences
Use Cases:
for: When you know the number of iterations.
while: When the number of iterations is not known in advance.
do-while: Similar to while, but guarantees at least one execution.
foreach: Specifically designed for iterating over arrays.
Initialization and Increment:

for: Requires explicit initialization and increment.
while and do-while: Initialization and increment are done outside the loop.
