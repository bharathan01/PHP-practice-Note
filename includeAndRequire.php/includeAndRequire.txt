In PHP, include and require are used to include and evaluate the contents of a file within another file. 
They are useful for modularizing code and reusing common components across multiple pages.

include:
If the file to be included is not found, include generates a warning but continues to execute the script.
In this case, a warning is generated, but the script continues to execute.

require:
If the file to be included is not found, require generates a fatal error and stops the script execution.
In this case, a fatal error occurs, and the script stops executing.
